# Short Snake: rules

1. The snake is a single bone
2. The snake begins in the middle of the screen
3. The player selects a direction for the snake to move (up, down, left or right) using the arrow keys
4. If the snake encounters food, the speed at which it moves increases
5. If the snake hits the side of the screen, it dies
6. Food appears at the start of the game in a random location in the screen
7. Each time a piece of food is eaten, another piece of food appears at a random location on the screen

# How do do this?

We have provided a [detailed walkthrough](../steps/coding_up_short_snake.md) of the steps needed to code up short snake using principles of object oriented programming. We recommend all but the most intrepid of coders follow the walkthrough!

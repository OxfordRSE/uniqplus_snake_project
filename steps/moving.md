# Moving objects

In this vignette, we are going to describe how we can use objects move across the screen in response to arrow keys being pressed.

We are going to start with our rectangle in the middle of the screen and allow it to move left, right, up or down in response to pressing of the keys. We are going to do this in such a way that the rectangle continues to move in a direction unless keys are pressed which make it move in a different direction.
